## Project Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd EduFlow-AcademySuite
    ```

2.  **Environment Variables:**
    -   Copy the example environment file:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    -   Populate the `.env` file with your specific credentials for the database (DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_HOST, DB_PORT), Django `SECRET_KEY`, and API keys. This file is intentionally not tracked by Git.

3.  **Setup Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Database Setup:**
    -   Ensure you have a PostgreSQL instance running (or use the provided Docker Compose setup).
    -   The database tables will be created by Django's migration system.

6.  **Run Initial Migrations:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

7.  **Create a Superuser (Admin):**
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

8.  **Run the Development Server:**
    ```bash
